# Credit-Card-Customers-Segmentation-Profiling

This case requires trainees to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The 
sample data-set summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the 
last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Requirements :-

1. Advanced data preparation. Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving ‘intelligent’ KPI’s 
such as monthly average purchase and cash advance amount, purchases by type (one-off, installments), average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction, limit usage (balance to 
credit limit ratio), payments to minimum payments ratio etc.  

2. Advanced reporting. Use the derived KPI’s to gain insight on the customer profiles.  

3. Clustering. Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a 
clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioral segments of credit card holders.

Statistical tool used was R-studio & SAS.
